# Analysis of the UNAM's admission examThe UNAM is by far the most important university inMexico. Interestingly, they makeall the scores of the first (of two) admission exams public at theirwebsite. About 106,000 people took the first test in 2009, of which ~7,500 were admitted, so we're talking about some of the best students in Mexico.According to the web page where the results were made public:> Hecho en México, todos los derechos reservados 2009. Esta página puede ser reproducida con fines no lucrativos, siempre y cuando no se mutile, se cite la fuente completa y su dirección electrónica. De otra forma requiere permiso previo por escrito de la institución.I take this to mean I can include the .csv files of the results scraped from the [UNAM's webpage](https://servicios.dgae.unam.mx/Febrero2009/resultados/index.html)## Scores by Major and FacultyThe UNAM has various educational establishments throughout Mexico City("planteles" which I translated as campuses). As you can see in thecharts, the one located in CU is by far the best one:![Mathy](http://imgur.com/OGRAI.png)There are a bunch of Faculties in CU which we can rank individualy andcompare to the other campuses:![Mathy](http://imgur.com/4lQXt.png)![Health](http://imgur.com/zCje1.png)![Health](http://imgur.com/QhHu5.png)## Do smart students earn more?The average score of the different majors in the admission exam predicts their salaries. Though if you're smart enough to study mechatronics you'd be better of studying medicine, not only will you get a better salary, you'll command more respect ;)![](http://imgur.com/71oe5.png)## Is the UNAM really the best school in Mexico?The highest scoring major with more than 15 students is medicine. TheFaculty of Medicine located in CU has the best students by far:![](http://imgur.com/FGia2.png)To enter an internship at a hospital students at all universities  have to take an exam called ENARM, and while the UNAM certainly does better than average (the chart only includes the top scoring schools), it is not by any means the best scoring school.![](http://imgur.com/ag4ig.png)At the Faculty of Medicine 47% percent passed the ENARM, while at theFES Iztacla only 27%, and at the FES Zaragosa 33%. If we assume thescores from the admission exam predict who will pass the ENARM, thento obtain a 47% pass rate at the Faculty of Medicine we would get acutoff score of 106, 105 at the FES Zaragoza and 104 at the FESIztacala. As we can see the scores in each campus predict pretty wellhow well the students will do in the ENARM.If the hightest scoring students in the UNAM pass the ENARM at a lowerrate than those of other public and private universities... Well,actually, different medical specialities (psychiatry, legal medicine,epidemiology, etc) have different pass rates, and god knows how theybreak down at each university. Plus this is only one major, for example, La Salle has a good reputation as a med school,but not so much for the other majors. Still it looks like prettystrong evidence against the quality of the UNAM.It looks like the [high ranking attributed to the UNAM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Autonomous_University_of_Mexico#Rankings),in international comparisons is due to having over 200,000 studentsrather than because of an extremely high academic quality. Sort of like ranking Mexico above Switzerland because it has a higher GDP due to having 108,000,000 people to Switzerland's 7,000,0000. Total GDP is important, but GDP per Capita also matters.### Sources[UNAM Admission Results](https://servicios.dgae.unam.mx/Febrero2009/resultados/index.html)Salaries: Newspaper Reforma[ENARM Results](http://www.scribd.com/doc/16624058/universidades)
